# FlightPubFinal



Notes about these notes :)
This project is the final project for the implementation phase of flightpub. It's got issues due to the testing part of the assignment occuring now, however I've left included the notes on the first semester's submission as it still shows how to set it up.


Notes about the Project:
This project is one of the first big group assignments I've worked on in University, it involved designing, documenting and implementing the project. 
At the moment the project is only half done as it's mean't to be completed over two semesters and this work is from the first. 

My role in the project:
During the project I found myself and another group member both being equal leaders in the project. I personally found myself designing how all the backend features worked. This includes the design but not implementation of the destination graph, database design and implementation 
and the design and implementation of the search function. I also found myself allocating backend work to various group members.

Technical Info:
Views-JSPS
Frameworks-Springframeworks
Backend language-Java
Database- MariaDB(MySQL)
Tomcat
IDE-Inteliji Ultimate

Tips for Running:
Open up into Inteliji and run database scripts:
1.Final Script
2.FP Data
3.FP Update
4.FP UpdateTimes
5.Test data for hotel.

If you can't get your database to work you'll need to update the information in the meta-inf/context.xml folder. You'll need to have MariaDB installed to get this to work. You'll also have to have tomcat installed and configured to work with your inteliji as well to get the website to deploy. 
Click build and run tomcat. 

Good times :) Any issues please contact me c3303000@uon.edu.au

Description of the Project:
The project is to design and implement a new flight agency website. The goal with this is to implement new and interesting features for different potential users of the website.
For our project my group and I decided to cater to both business and recreational users. We decided to ask the user what type of user they were during account creation and
only presented the features that were relevant to that user group.
